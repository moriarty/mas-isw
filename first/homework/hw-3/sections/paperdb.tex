    I will be using Mendeley to organize my papers. Some features which it offers include: 
    \begin{itemize}
    	\item Cross Platform, including mobile
    	\item Software not required. Can use from any broswer and the articles will be synced when you log in from your own computer.
    	\item Exports the database to BibTex and automatically keeps it synced. 
    	\item Has a MODERN \& usable graphical user interface.
    \end{itemize}
