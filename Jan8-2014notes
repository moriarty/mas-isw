How To write papers:

general rules of knowing your readers.
1/3, 1/3, 1/3
1/3 of the paper should be readable by nearly anyone.
1/3 of the paper should be readable by everyone in your specific field, maybe with a bit of background checking.
1/3 of the paper should be in depth details readable by specialists in your topic.

Simple trick: first write only bullets.
By writing only bullets containing single thoughts, and then checking the list of bullets to ensure they're all unique bullets
bullets can quickly be rearranged for clarity, and because the bullets are unique wordiness and repeating can be avoided. We're trying to avoid talking a lot and saying little.

Do not narrate. Interested in scientific facts. Of interested is what happened, and why. Not who told you do to something. Avoid: "I then did blah blah"
