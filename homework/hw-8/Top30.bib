abstract = {Research in robotic systems has traditionally been identified with approaches that are charac- terized by the use of carefully crafted representations and processes to find optimal solutions. The use of such representations and processes, which we refer to as the algorithmic approach, is uniquely suited for problems requiring strong models, i.e., tasks and domains that are well defined, and/or involve close interaction with the environment. These problems have histori- cally been the focus of robotics research because they exercise perceptual, motor and manip- ulation capabilities that form the basic foundational abilities required for every robotic agent. Recent work (for example ROS and Tekkotsu) on the abstraction and encapsulation of percep- tion and motor functionality has standardized the above mentioned foundational abilities and allowed researchers to study problems in less clearly defined and open-ended domains: prob- lems that have previously been considered the province of AI and Cognitive Science. In this paper, we argue that the study of these problems (examples of which include multi-agent inter- action, instruction following and reasoning in complex domains) referred to under the rubric of Cognitive Robotics is best achieved via the use of cognitive architectures – unified computa- tional frameworks developed specifically for general problem solving and human cognitive mod- eling. We lay out the relevant architectural concepts and principles and illustrate them using nine cognitive architectures that are under active development - Soar, ACT-R, CLARION, GMU-BICA, Polyscheme, Co-JACK, ADAPT, ACT-R/E, and SS-RICS.},

abstract = {Robotics researchers increasingly agree that ideas from biology and self-organization can strongly benefit the design of autonomous robots. Biological organisms have evolved to perform and survive in a world characterized by rapid changes, high uncertainty, indefinite richness, and limited availability of information. Industrial robots, in contrast, operate in highly controlled environments with no or very little uncertainty. Although many challenges remain, concepts from biologically inspired (bio-inspired) robotics will eventually enable researchers to engineer machines for the real world that possess at least some of the desirable properties of biological organisms, such as adaptivity, robustness, versatility, and agility.},

abstract = {RatSLAM is a biologically-inspired visual SLAM and navigation system that has been shown to be effective indoors and outdoors on real robots. The spatial representation at the core of RatSLAM, the experience map, forms in a distributed fashion as the robot learns the environment. The activity in RatSLAM’s experience map possesses some geometric properties, but still does not represent the world in a human readable form. A new system, dubbed RatChat, has been introduced to enable meaningful communication with the robot. The intention is to use the “language games” paradigm to build spatial concepts that can be used as the basis for communication. This paper describes the first step in the language game experiments, showing the potential for meaningful categorization of the spatial representations in RatSLAM.},

Bionic hand is a humanlike hand that has soft skin with distributed receptors and is driven by artiﬁcial pneumatic muscles. At the beginning of learning, it utilizes the result of physical interaction with the object: thanks to the hand compliance, regrasping will leads object’s posture to stable one in the hand. This result can be successively used as object classiﬁcation for learning dynamic interaction between the hand and the object by a recurrent neural network. We conduct experiments and show that the proposed method is effective for robust and fast object recognition.},

After introducing central concepts of dynamic field theory (DFT), we probe empirical predictions and findings around two examples—the DFT of infant perseverative reaching that explains Piaget’s A-not-B error and the DFT of spatial memory that explain changes in spatial cognition in early develop- ment. Review of the literature around these examples reveals that computational modeling is having an impact on empirical research in cognitive development; however, this impact does not extend to neural and clinical research. Moreover, there is a tendency for researchers to interpret models narrowly, anchoring them to spe- cific tasks. We conclude on an optimistic note, encouraging both theoreticians and experimentalists to work toward a more theory- driven future.},

abstract = {The discipline of robotics has emerged from developments in industrial robots where precision is of primary importance. Robotics research continues to contribute to the creation of objects and robotic systems that improve the quality of our lives. However, the body of knowledge generated in robotics is making an impact beyond robot applications. Recent developments coupled with advancement of computing technology facilitated the application of robotics knowledge to create robotic systems that can operate in unstructured environments occupied by humans, providing service and assisting humans. Furthermore, robotics as a science is being applied and contributing to the development of other disciplines not traditionally associated with robotics. These include computer graphics and animation towards realistic physical simulations of motions and interactions of moving bodies as they collide and interact with each other. Other applications include the study of motion-based behaviors of biological/organic materials including humans. The development of dynamic models of articulated bodies is central for achieving realistic motions and for the design of effective controllers with the needed performance in motions and interactions. These models are especially useful in simulation environments. At the same time, advancements in biology and other disciplines are having a significant influence on the developments in robotics. This synergy between robotics and emerging applications is resulting, for example, in biomimetic robotic systems with mechanical designs closer to biological beings and their learning capabilities. In this presentation, we will discuss models and algorithms in robotics and highlight examples showing their diverse applications.},

This field of biologically inspired technology, having the moniker biomimetics, has evolved from making static copies of human and animals in the form of statues to the emergence of robots that operate with realistic appearance and behavior. Technology evolution led to such fields as artificial muscles, artificial intelligence, artificial vision and biomimetic capabilities in materials science, mechanics, electronics, computing science, information technology and many others. One of the newest fields is the artificial muscles, which is the moniker for electroactive polymers (EAP). Efforts are made worldwide to establish a strong infrastructure for this actuation materials ranging from analytical modeling and comprehensive understanding of their response mechanism to effective processing and characterization techniques. The field is still in its emerging state and robust materials are still not readily available however in recent years significant progress has been made. To promote faster advancement in the field, in 1999, the author posed a challenge to the research and engineering community to develop a robotic arm that would wrestle against human opponent and win. Currently, he is considering setting up the first competition in 2005. This paper covers the current state-of-the-art and challenges to making biomimetic robots using artificial muscles.},

Taking a systems perspective rather than focusing narrowly on materials or chemistry aspects, Biomimetics: Biologically Inspired Technologies examines the field from every angle. The book contains pioneering approaches to biomimetics including a new perspective on the mechanization of cognition and intelligence, as well as defense and attack strategies in nature, their applications, and potential. It surveys the field from modeling to applications and from nano- to macro-scales, beginning with an introduction to principles of using biology to inspire designs as well as biological mechanisms as models for technology. This innovative guide discusses evolutionary robotics; genetic algorithms; molecular machines; multifunctional, biological-, and nano- materials; nastic structures inspired by plants; and functional surfaces in biology. Looking inward at biological systems, the book covers the topics of biomimetic materials, structures, control, cognition, artificial muscles, biosensors that mimic senses, artificial organs, and interfaces between engineered and biological systems. The final chapter contemplates the future of the field and outlines the challenges ahead.

@article{Strauss2012,
abstract = {The paper presents a robotics-based model for choice reaching experiments on visual attention. In these experiments participants were asked to make rapid reach movements toward a target in an odd-color search task, i.e., reaching for a green square among red squares and vice versa (e.g., Song and Nakayama, 2008). Interestingly these studies found that in a high number of trials movements were initially directed toward a distractor and only later were adjusted toward the target. These "curved" trajectories occurred particularly frequently when the target in the directly preceding trial had a different color (priming effect). Our model is embedded in a closed-loop control of a LEGO robot arm aiming to mimic these reach movements. The model is based on our earlier work which suggests that target selection in visual search is implemented through parallel interactions between competitive and cooperative processes in the brain (Heinke and Humphreys, 2003; Heinke and Backhaus, 2011). To link this model with the control of the robot arm we implemented a topological representation of movement parameters following the dynamic field theory (Erlhagen and Schoener, 2002). The robot arm is able to mimic the results of the odd-color search task including the priming effect and also generates human-like trajectories with a bell-shaped velocity profile. Theoretical implications and predictions are discussed in the paper.},

We extend a neural-dynamic architecture for grounded spatial language in three ways: First, viewer- centered vs. intrinsic reference frames may be autonomously selected. Using intrinsic reference frames requires estimation of the orientation of the reference object. Second, we employ a similar orientation estimation to enable the use of configurations of reference objects for spatial terms such as “between”. Third, we enhance the autonomy of the system so that the required sequence of attentional shifts, coordinate transforms, and selection decisions emerges from the time-continuous neural dynamics. By implementing the approach in a robotic setting we demonstrate that simple feature information obtained from video cameras is sufficient to ground spatial language.},

Each action in a sequence must contribute to the behavioral objective, while at the same time satisfying constraints that arise from the environment, the agent’s embodiment, and the agent’s behavioral history. In this paper, we introduce a neural-dynamic architecture that enables selection of an appropriate action for a given task in a particular environment and is open to learning. We use the same framework of neural dynamics for all processes from perception, to representation and motor planning as well as behavioral organization. This facilitates integration and flexibility. The neural dynamic representations of particular behaviors emerge on the fly from the interplay between task and environment inputs as well as behavioral history. All behavioral states are attractors of the neural dynamics, whose instabilities lead to behavioral switches. As a result, behavioral organization is robust in the face of noisy and unreliable sensory information.},

On the one hand, we have the fantasy of such anthropomorphic robots as C3PO from Star Wars and Commander Data from Star Trek: The Next Generation which, despite their endearing quirks, negotiate complex physical and social environments with essentially the skill of a human being. On the other hand, we have the reality of industrial robots that can efficiently carry out such highly specialized tasks as painting and welding only in environments carefully constrained to minimize complications. Or, to consider a second example, we have Dante II, the semi-autonomous robot that had to be lifted out of a volcano it was exploring with a crane when it overturned. Far from being a limitation unique to the Dante II project, which should be applauded for confronting such a difficult environment, this brittleness in the face of unanticipated contingency is in fact typical of the state of the art in autonomous robotics.},

In this paper, we extend this algorithm to handle data association problems and report real-world results, obtained with an outdoor vehicle. We find that our approach performs favorably when compared to the extended Kalman filter solution from which it is derived.},

@article{Morse2011,
abstract = {From the perspective of cognitive robotics, this paper presents a modern interpretation of Newell’s (1973) reasoning and suggestions for why and how cognitive psychologists should develop models of cognitive phenomena. We argue that the shortcomings of current cognitive modelling approaches are due in significant part to a lack of exactly the kind of integration required for the development of embodied autonomous robotics. Moreover we suggest that considerations of embodiment, situatedness, and autonomy, intrinsic to cognitive robotics, provide an appropriate basis for the integration and theoretic cumulation that Newell argued was necessary for psychology to mature. From this perspective we analyse the role of embodiment and modes of situatedness in terms of integration, cognition, emotion, and autonomy. Four complementary perspectives on embodied and situated cognitive science are considered in terms of their poten- tial to contribute to cognitive robotics, cognitive science, and psychological theorizing: minimal cognition and organization, enactive perception and sensorimotor contingency, homeostasis and emotion, and social embedding. In combination these perspectives provide a framework for cognitive robotics, not only wholly compatible with the original aims of cognitive modelling, but as a more appropriate methodology than those currently in common use within psychology.},

@article{Milford2004,
abstract = {The paper presents a new approach to the problem of Simultaneous Localization and Mapping - SLAM - inspired by computational models of the hippocampus of rodents. The rodents hippocampus has been extensively studied with respect to navigation tasks, and displays many of the properties of a desirable SLAM solution. RatSLAM is an implementation of a hippocampal model that can perform SLAM in real time on a real robot. It uses competitive attractor network to integrate odometric information with landmark sensing to form a consistent representation of the environment. Experimental results show that RatSLAM can operate with ambiguous landmark information and recover from both minor and major path integration errors.},

@article{Maddern2012,
abstract = {This paper describes a new system, dubbed Continuous Appearance-based Trajectory Simultaneous Localisation and Mapping (CAT-SLAM), which augments sequential appearance-based place recognition with local metric pose filtering to improve the frequency and reliability of appearance-based loop closure. As in other approaches to appearance-based mapping, loop closure is performed without calculating global feature geometry or performing 3D map construction. Loop-closure filtering uses a probabilistic distribution of possible loop closures along the robot’s previous trajectory,which is represented by a linked list of previously visited locations linked by odometric information. Sequential appearance-based place recognition and local metric pose filtering are evaluated simultaneously using a Rao–Blackwellised particle filter, which weights particles based on appearance matching over sequential frames and the similarity of robot motion along the trajectory. The particle filter explicitly models both the likelihood of revisiting previous locations and exploring new locations. A modified resampling scheme counters particle deprivation and allows loop-closure updates to be performed in constant time for a given environment. We compare the performance of CAT-SLAM with FAB-MAP (a state-of-the-art appearance-only SLAM algorithm) using multiple real-world datasets, demonstrating an increase in the number of correct loop closures detected by CAT-SLAM.},

@article{Lipinski2012,
abstract = {We propose a neural dynamic model that specifies how low-level visual processes can be integrated with higher level cognition to achieve flexible spatial language behaviors. This model uses real-word visual input that is linked to relational spatial descriptions through a neural mechanism for reference frame transformations. We demonstrate that the system can extract spatial relations from visual scenes, select items based on relational spatial descriptions, and perform reference object selection in a single unified architecture. We further show that the performance of the system is consistent with behavioral data in humans by simulating results from 2 independent empirical studies, 1 spatial term rating task and 1 study of reference object selection behavior. The architecture we present thereby achieves a high degree of task flexibility under realistic stimulus conditions. At the same time, it also provides a detailed neural grounding for complex behavioral and cognitive processes.},

The core model, dubbed RatSLAM, has been demonstrated to have exactly the same advantages described earlier: it can build, maintain, and use maps simultaneously over extended periods of time and can construct maps of large and complex areas from very weak geometric information. The work contrasts with other efforts to embody models of rat brains in robots. The article describes the key elements of the known biology of the rat brain in relation to navigation and how the RatSLAM model captures the ideas from biology in a fashion suitable for implementation on a robotic platform. The paper then outline RatSLAM's performance in two difficult robot navigation challenges, demonstrating how a cognitive robotics approach to navigation can produce results that rival other state of the art approaches in robotics.},
