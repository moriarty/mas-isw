    \framesubtitle{An summary of Mind Mapping}
    \begin{itemize}
    		\item A way of graphically representing your mind.
    		\item Adds the overhead in the graphical software interface
    		\item If you have whiteboards, it's probably faster
    		\item The advantage is issue and task tracking, but their are easier ways (Github Issues, other to do list software)
    		\item Maybe they work for some people, but it's a personal preference. 
    \end{itemize}
