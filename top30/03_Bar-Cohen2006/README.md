Evolution has resolved many of nature’s challenges leading to lasting solutions. Nature has always inspired human achievements and has led to effective materials, structures, tools, mechanisms, processes, algorithms, methods, systems, and many other benefits (Bar-Cohen Y (ed) 2005 *Biomimetics—Biologically Inspired Technologies* (Boca Raton, FL: CRC Press)
pp 1–552). This field, which is known as biomimetics, offers enormous potential for inspiring new capabilities for exciting future technologies. There are numerous examples of biomimetic successes that involve making simple copies, such as the use of fins for swimming. Others examples involved greater mimicking complexity including the mastery of flying that became possible only after the principles of aerodynamics were better understood. Some commercial implementations of biomimetics, including robotic toys and movie subjects, are increasingly appearing and behaving like living creatures. More substantial benefits of biomimetics include the development of prosthetics that closely mimic real limbs and sensory-enhancing microchips that are interfaced with the brain to assist in hearing, seeing and controlling instruments. A review is given of selected areas that were inspired by nature, and an outlook for potential development in biomimetics is presented.

= Summary =
__Biomimetics__, the synthetic replication of nature's procedures and approaches, is discussed in general with the goal of encouraging learning from nature. Replication of nature is not required, nor is it nessecarily desired, the long term outlook is to create the building blocks to enable future production of devices currently restricted to the realm of science fiction. 

An important aspect of __Biomimetics__ which is clearly expressed in the structure and organization of this papers sections and subsections, is that of *abstraction*. When deriving solutions and ideas from Biological concepts, it is important to chose a level of abstraction appropriate to what your goals are. When humans looked at birds and first designed planes using a flapping wing method, little success was had, only recently have developments in light wieght materials have biomimetic flapping wing robots been possible. But, a similar concept, fins, provided a successful platform for developing propulsion and control methods in both water and air. 

__Biology as a model__
To look at biological systems as models to base engineered solutions on, it is suggested to sort capabilities and match those with fields of engineering. The __following table__ is provided. The table provides their analogy between biological and engineering terms. Examples of systems which have been successfully created from biological models include camouflage and sonar.
